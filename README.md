# REST Screenshoot

REST Screenshoot is a free tool for capturing screenshots of webpages via a REST API. It provides a simple, easy-to-use endpoint URL for generating screenshots.

## Endpoint URL

To generate a screenshot, make a GET request to the following endpoint URL, replacing `{url}` with the URL of the webpage you want to capture:

`https://rest-screenshoot.fly.dev/screenshot?url={url}`

## Example

To capture a screenshot of the React Table server-side pagination, search, and sort order story on Metaphore, use this URL:

`https://rest-screenshoot.fly.dev/screenshot?url=https://metaphore.vercel.app/stories/javascript/react-table-sever-side-pagination-search-sortorder`

The resulting screenshot will be returned as a PNG image.
